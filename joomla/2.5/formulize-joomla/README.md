formulize-joomla
================

Component for the integration of Formulize into Joomla.

It takes care of getting the webmaster input and of displaying the Formulize Screens accordingly.

It also take care of the initial user and group synchronization between the two systems.

For full functionality, it needs to be installed with formulize-plugin. 

Those two parts will be combined at a later point in one single package.


***Note to Julian***
