</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Formulize provides 'Quick Search Boxes' and 'Quick Search Filters', as variables, that you can include however you want in your Top Templates.</p>\n
<ul>
<li>Use quickSearchBox_<i>handle</i> for a simple search box, ie: \$quickSearchBox_profile_dept</li>
<li>Use quickSearchFilter_<i>handle</i> for a dropdown filter, ie: \$quickSearchFilter_profile_dept</li>
<li>Use quickSearchNegativeFilter_<i>handle</i> for a dropdown filter that excludes values, ie: \$quickSearchNegativeFilter_profile_dept</li>
<li>Use quickSearchMultiFilter_<i>handle</i> for a checkbox filter where the user selects multiple values, ie: \$quickSearchMultiFilter_profile_dept</li>
<li>Use quickSearchDateRange_<i>handle</i> for a date range filter (only on Date elements), ie: \$quickSearchDateRange_profile_dept</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> you must turn off the Quick Search Boxes at the top of the columns, in the settings for this list, before you can use them in a top template.</p>\n
<p><b>Note:</b> Quick Searches will only work for columns you have included in this screen. If a column would not be visible if the screen loaded normally (without a custom template), then the quicksearch box will not function.</p>\n
<p>For Custom Buttons, use \"\$handle\" where <i>handle</i> is the handle you specified for that button.  You can use \"\$messageText\" to control where the clicked button's message will appear on the screen.  By default, the message appears centred at the top.</p>\n<p>If the current view list is available, you can determine which view was last selected from the list, by checking whether <i>\$The_view_name</i> is true or not.  You can also check <i>\$viewX</i> where X is a number corresponding to the position of the view in the list, 1 through n.  You can use this to put if..else clauses into your template, so it changes depending what view is selected.</p>\n<p><b>List Item Template</b></p>\n<p>If you specify any PHP code for the List Item Template, it will be used to draw in each row of the list.</p>\n<p>You do not need to create a foreach loop or any other loop structure in this template.  The PHP code you specify will be executed inside a loop that runs once for each entry.</p>\n<p>You have full access to Formulize objects, functions, variables and constants in this template, including <i>\$fid</i> for the form ID.  Use \$entry to refer to the current entry in the list.  For example:</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: courier\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;getValue(\$entry, \"phonenumber\");</p>\n<p>That code will display the phone number recorded in that entry (assuming \"phonenumber\" is a valid element handle).</p><p>You can use \"\$selectionCheckbox\" to display the special checkbox used to select an entry.</p><p>You can use a special function called \"viewEntryLink\" to create a link to the entry so users can edit it.  This function takes up to three parameters.  The first is the text that will be clickable.  Examples:</p><p style=\"font-family: courier\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print viewEntryLink(\"Click to view this entry\");<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print viewEntryLink(getValue(\$entry, \"taskname\"));<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print viewEntryLink(\"&lt;img src='images/button.jpg'&gt;\");</p>
<p>Optionally, you can also specify a specific entry to edit, and also which screen to edit it in.  This is often useful when the dataset contains more than one form (from a relationship), and you are using the <i>internalRecordIds</i> function to identify which entries in the other forms are being included.  Examples:</p><p style=\"font-family: courier\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print viewEntryLink(\"Click to view this entry\", 123); // takes the user to entry 123 in this form<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\$ids = getEntryIds(\$entry, 12); <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foreach(\$ids as \$id) { <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\$taskname = getValue(\$entry, \"taskname\", \"\", \$id);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print viewEntryLink(\$taskname, \$id, 45); <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above example gets all the ids of the records from form 12<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that are part of the current entry (ie: this row).  Form 12 is presumably<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a subform in a relationship to the form that this screen belongs to.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the code loops through all the ids of the subform entries,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for each one it gets the value of the task name element in that entry.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it makes a clickable link out of the task name, that will send the user<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to that subform entry, and will use screen 45 to display the entry (presumably<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;screen 45 is a regular form screen for form 12).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*/</p>
<p>You can also use <i>viewEntryButton</i> instead of <i>viewEntryLink</i> if you want a clickable button instead of a link.</p>
<p>You can use a special function called \"clickableSortLink\" to create a clickable element on the page, so users can control the sorting order of entries in the list.  This function takes two parameters.  The first is the element handle of the element you want to sort by.  The second is the text or HTML that you want to be clickable.  When the sort is active, a black triangle will appear next to the clickable element.  Examples:</p><p style=\"font-family: courier\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print clickableSortLink(\"last_name\", \"Sort by last name\");<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print clickableSortLink(\"creation_datetime\", \"&lt;img src='images/clock.jpg'&gt;\");</p>
