To get behavior of HTML Purifier prior to 4.0.0, set this directive to false. Some rational behind the auto-detection: in previous versions of HTML Purifier, it was assumed that the form of class was NMTOKENS, as specified by the XHTML Modularization (representing XHTML 1.1 and XHTML 2.0). The DTDs for HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0, however specify class as CDATA.
