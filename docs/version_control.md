# Version Control

We use [Github]({{ site.github.repository_url }}) as our version control system. We have a unified process in Github for branching, testing, documentation and merging:

1. Checkout the master branch [help](./branching)
2. Create a new branch based on master [help](./branching)
3. Start a pull request an GitHub [help](./branching)
4. Make code changes, push to your branch regularly
5. Update/create documentation where applicable [help](./documentation)
6. Give "thumbs up" in your pull request when you think it is ready
7. A maintainer will review the pull request and merge it
8. A maintainer will publish the documentation updates, if any [help](../github_pages)

For more details about each major part of this process, see the following pages:

* [New Features and Branching](branching)
* [Testing](testing)
* [Documentation](documentation)
* [Code Review, Pull Requests and Merging](merging)
