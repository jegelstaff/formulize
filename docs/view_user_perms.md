## View User Permissions
Formulize has a lot of different permissions that someone can have, which are set by the groups that the user belong to.
To see what all permissions a specific user has, and which permission comes from which group, you can follow the steps
below:

1. Go to the Admin page -> Select the form your are working with.

2. Go to the 'Permissions' tab.


3. Scroll down to the 'Review permissions for a user' section, enter the username in the textbox.
**Note:** you'll have to search by the **Display Name** of the user, not he/she's loggin name.

4. Press 'Enter' or click 'Show permissions for the user'
