# Deploying Formulize to a Website

__If you're trying to update an existing Formulize system__, check out the [Updating Formulize page](../deploying_a_website/updating_formulize).

## Quick Start

1. __Get the Formulize files onto your web server.__ We recommend using ```git```. See below. You could also [download the latest release from GitHub](https://github.com/jegelstaff/formulize/zipball/{{ site.github.latest_release.tag_name }}), and transfer the files to your web server however you see fit.

2. __Put the files in the folder where you want Formulize to exist__, ie:
- if you want Formulize to exist at ```https://www.mysite.com``` then put the files in the web root.
- if you want Formulize to be in a subfolder like ```https://www.mysite.com/formulize``` then put the files in the ```/formulize``` folder, inside the web root.

3. __Make sure [the folders that need to be writable](../deploying_a_website/writable_folders) are writable by the web server user.__

4. __Open a web browser and go to the location where you put Formulize.__ The installer will appear. [Follow the steps for using the installer](../deploying_a_website/installing_formulize)

## Getting the files onto your server with git

We recommend cloning the GitHub repository so that it's easy to track any changes, and easy to update Formulize in the future.

```bash
# ssh to your server
# then go to the folder where you want to install Formulize
cd /path/where/you/want/formulize

# make sure the folder is empty
# delete any contents if necessary

# clone Formulize from GitHub into this folder
# don't forget the dot at the end!
git clone {{ site.github.repository_url }}.git .

# make your own branch to track changes
git checkout -b my-formulize-branch
```

Regardless of how you get the files on your server, the next steps are the same:

- Make sure [the folders that need to be writable](../deploying_a_website/writable_folders) are writable by the web server user.

- Open a web browser and go to the location where you put Formulize. The installer will appear. [Follow the steps for using the installer](../deploying_a_website/installing_formulize)

## If you're using git, commit changes regularly to your branch

As you use Formulize, some configuration changes are stored in files on the server. These files will show up in ```git``` as changes.

Periodically, you should review the changes, and commit them to your branch. It's generally a good idea to automate this to run nightly, using ```cron``` and a bash script. That way, you have a regular history of changes.

For details of how to update your Formulize site using ```git```, check out the [Updating Formulize](../deploying_a_website/updating_formulize) page.

## If you're not using git, consider deleting some folders and files

Some of the folders and files are not necessary for the actual operation of Formulize on a live website.

If you are using ```git``` to manage the files, it's best __not__ to remove these, although you could. It would create merge challenges later if you do remove them.

However, if you're __not__ using ```git```, then these folders are basically taking up extra space and serving no purpose, so you might as well delete them:

* /.github/
* /.sauce/
* /.vscode/
* /docker/
* /docs/
* /install/ (only delete __after__ completing the installation!)
* /tests/
* /trust/ (do __not__ delete if you used this as your actual trust path!)
* .editorconfig
* .gitignore
* docker-compose.yml
