# SCSS and Sass

## What are SCSS and Sass?

**Formulize does not currently make use of SCSS and Sass. CSS is written directly in the applicable CSS files.**

SCSS is a superset of CSS3 which, when run through the Sass pre-compiler, produces CSS. The basics of Sass and SCSS usage can be found [here](http://sass-lang.com/guide).

## Installing Sass

It is necessary to install Ruby before installing Sass. Once Ruby is installed, Sass can be installed via command line with the command:

    gem install sass

Successful installation can be confirmed by running:

    sass -v

## Compiling SCSS Files Using Sass

Sass is used to make CSS files from SCSS files. In order to do so, simply run the command:

    sass input.scss output.css
